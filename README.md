## Overview

### The challenge

- pug
  - This is my first time using pug, spent some time to figure out syntax, and I thought it was pretty cool, I would consider using it in the next side project.

- vue3 script setup
  - it's a new feature from vue compile-time syntactic sugar, and also spent some the to read the documentation that new syntax

- tailwindcss
  - Infrequently used, so the syntax is not very familiar, need to check the documentation from time to time
